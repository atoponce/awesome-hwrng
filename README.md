# Awesome Hardware Random Number Generators

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This table is a list of hardware random number generators that was initially on
Wikipedia, but [has since been removed][1], as it did not meet certain
guidelines.

Table sort is not supported in Github like it is in Wikipedia, but if you
install [Greasemonkey][2] and the [Github Sort Content][3] user script in your
browser, you will then be able to sort the table columns.
